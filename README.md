# The Assignment: Professional README Generator:

* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

* WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository

* THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

* WHEN I enter my project title

* THEN this is displayed as the title of the README

* WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions

* THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

* WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options

* THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

* WHEN I enter my GitHub username

* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

* WHEN I enter my email address

* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

* WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents

* THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

This is a command line assignment run through the terminal using the npm inquirer, node.js, and saving it to a index.js file. This assignment was much different than any other assignment as it had no deployable webpage and lived entirely on the terminal. From writing to testing to fixing bugs this was all done in the terminal. The assignment details are above and it explains what is needed to create and finish the assignment. It starts with just a simple Title and placing that title to the corresponding part of the page. To complete the tasks of the assignment one needs to have an understanding of a markdown file and its syntax. When titling a page it needs to have a single # so that in a README the markdown file knows its a title. Also each heading block needs a double ## to interpret those as headings. Syntax for a markdown includes a lot and reading documentation can help with that as well. 

# Lessons:

This assignment taught me a lot about designing webpages and writing files using a npm library and testing it through the terminal. This showed me that the fact that back end web development is a totally different type of coding. It is written, tested, debugged, and displayed completely different than any other web development we have done so far. To use the npm library it needs to be installed into the file or repository it will be utilized with once it is installed the library has a multitude of capabilities that can be accessed just by reading the documentation. Another lesson I have learned in this assignment was the gitignore its a way to gave GitHub ignore certain parts of the file i.e. node modules which helps you to write and execute the code but isn't necessary to add to the repository since it can be added at any time when utilizing the file. 

# Takeaways: 

The assignment taught me things that I have never had to think about before about web development meaning writing and executing code completely in the terminal using back end web development. This assignment showed me licensing which is something we have never done before in any of our repositories. I had to utilize Google for that in order to fully understand what to put in the licensing and how it is used in the project. A big takeaway for me was the npm library and its many capabilities so much can be done with this resource. For example this entire assignment is based, built, and executed utilizing the npm library. I was able to practice with different inputs for the questions like checkboxes, lists, and editor. Not sure how to fully utilize the last one I tried it but then could never escape the actual editor to add it to the file so I didn't use that function but it was good to have experimented with it. This was a great assignment it was challenging in some ways but also a great learning experience that taught me a lot back end web development.
